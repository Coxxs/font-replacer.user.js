# font-replacer.user.js

Install: [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/437944-font-replacer)

Replace fonts hard coded by websites.

**You may want to edit this userscript and change replace rules.**

Due to a bug in Chrome for Windows, if the new font does not appear, please **uninstall your custom font** from Windows and **choose "Install for all users" when reinstalling the font** (Show more options -> Install for all users).

By default, it will replace common Chinese fonts to "Source Han Sans".

Tip: For websites that didn't hard-coded fonts, you can modify the fonts directly in your browser settings (e.g. chrome://settings/fonts) or use [extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-font-settings/caclkomlalccbpcdllchkeecicepbmbm).
