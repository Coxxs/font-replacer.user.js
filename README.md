Replace fonts hard coded by websites.

**You may want to edit this userscript and set the font you want to replace (or change replace rules).**

By default, it will replace common Chinese fonts to "Source Han Sans"

Tip: For websites that didn't hard-coded fonts, you can modify the fonts directly in your browser settings (e.g. chrome://settings/fonts) or use [extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-font-settings/caclkomlalccbpcdllchkeecicepbmbm).
